# ARTIFICAL INTELLINGENCE.
## What does AI mean?

AI stands for "Artificial Intelligence." It refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and even decision-making. 
AI'S are categorised into two types those being 
#### Narrow AI which are desired to perform a specific tasks for example Reccomandation systems,Langualage transilation tools and many others and 
#### Strong AI's are artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence
## How is an AI built?

Creating an AI involves several key steps, and the process can vary depending on the type of AI you're creating and the complexity of the task it's intended to perform. 
The following is an outline of the steps that can be considered during the building process of an AI
### Define the Task or Problem:

Clearly articulate the problem or task that the AI is intended to solve.
Specify the input data the AI will receive and the desired output or action.
### Collect and Prepare Data:

Gather relevant data that the AI will use for training and testing.
Clean, preprocess, and format the data to make it suitable for the AI algorithm.
### Choose an AI Approach:

Decide on the type of AI approach that best suits the task. Common approaches include rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, or a combination of these.
### Select Tools and Frameworks:

Choose programming languages, libraries, and frameworks that are suitable for the chosen AI approach.
Popular tools for machine learning and deep learning include Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more.
### Design the AI Model:

If using machine learning, design the architecture of the model, including the number of layers (for neural networks), type of algorithm, and parameters.
Specify how the model will process input data to generate output predictions or decisions.
### Train the Model:

Feed the AI model with labeled training data to allow it to learn patterns and relationships.
Adjust model parameters based on performance during training.
Validate the model on a separate dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
### Evaluate and Fine-Tune:

Assess the performance of the trained model using test data.
Fine-tune the model and iterate on the design if necessary to improve performance.
### Deploy the AI System:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy the AI system for use in the real world.
Integrate the AI into the intended application or system.
### Monitor and Maintain:

Regularly monitor the AI system's performance in a real-world environment.
Update the model as needed to adapt to changes in data distribution or task requirements.
## PRINCIPLES ON WHICH AN AI OPERATES 
### Data:

Many AI systems, especially those based on machine learning, operate on the principle of being data-driven. They learn patterns and make decisions based on the data they have been trained on.
### Algorithms:

  AI systems rely on algorithms, sets of instructions or rules, to process data and make decisions. The choice of algorithm can significantly impact the performance of the AI system.
### Learning:

 Machine learning-based AI systems have the ability to learn from data and adapt their behavior over time. This can involve supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or a combination of these.
## STEPS AN AI TAKES TO LOVE THE PROBLEM OR TASK GIVEN.
### Input:
The AI system takes in information from the external environment. This input could be in the form of data, images, text, speech, or any other relevant format depending on the nature of the task.

### Pre-processing: 
The input data is often pre-processed to extract relevant features and convert it into a format suitable for the AI algorithm. This step may involve tasks like data cleaning, normalization, or image preprocessing.

### Feature Extraction
In many AI tasks, relevant features are identified from the input data. Features are specific aspects or characteristics of the data that the AI system will use to make predictions or decisions.

### Model Training  
If the AI system is based on machine learning, it undergoes a training phase. During training, the AI is exposed to a labeled dataset, where it learns the patterns and relationships between input features and desired outputs. The goal is to enable the AI to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

### Decision Making or Inference
Once trained, the AI can make decisions or predictions based on new, unseen data. For machine learning models, this involves applying the learned patterns to the new input to generate an output or prediction.

### Output
The AI produces an output or result based on its processing of the input data. The output could be a decision, prediction, recommendation, or any other action relevant to the task.
